# nav-frc
A very outdated tool we used to help auto-generate autocode for our FRC bot.


This was a little tool developed for our beta bot as a proof of concept 
auto-code generator. The user plots points for the robot to follow using 
PID controllers on the encoders and the gyro, and it spits out the code 
to paste into our `autonoumousPeriodic` IterativeRobot method.

In the end, we used a different method of programming autonomous, so 
this was never used other than on our beta bot.
